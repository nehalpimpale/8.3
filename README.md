Q. Explain in brief the architecture of Apache Hadoop Yarn


The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the two major responsibilities of the JobTracker i.e. resource management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate daemons: a global ResourceManager and per-application ApplicationMaster (AM).

The ResourceManager and per-node slave, the NodeManager (NM), form the new, and generic, system for managing applications in a distributed manner.

The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific entity and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the component tasks.

The ResourceManager has a pluggable Scheduler, which is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications subject to familiar constraints of capacities, queues etc. The Scheduler is a pure scheduler in the sense that it performs no monitoring or tracking of status for the application, offering no guarantees on restarting failed tasks either due to application failure or hardware failures. The Scheduler performs its scheduling function based on the resource requirements of the applications; it does so based on the abstract notion of a Resource Container which incorporates resource elements such as memory, cpu, disk, network etc.

The NodeManager is the per-machine slave, which is responsible for launching the applicationsâ€™ containers, monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the ResourceManager.

The per-application ApplicationMaster has the responsibility of negotiating appropriate resource containers from the Scheduler, tracking their status and monitoring for progress. From the system perspective, the ApplicationMaster itself runs as a normal container.
